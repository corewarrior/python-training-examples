# python-training-examples

The python programs that are documented here are for my use when training python classes either at the college level or in our Linux Users Group.

The programs will be presented as a reference program for analysis and discussion. They can also be used as platforms to explore other ideas.

Don't have a complete idea of the total number yet. The programs presented in this repository will all be Python3 based. If a Python2 program is presented it will be used as a migration target for those that might have a large library pf Python2 programs they would like to migrate.
